## Key Findings

1. **Compensation Dominates Improvement Suggestions**: 62% of participants suggested compensation-related improvements, with 36% specifically mentioning effort-pay mismatch
2. **Transparency Concerns**: 18% of participants suggested transparency improvements, focusing on general process clarity
3. **Limited Support Suggestions**: Only 10% suggested support/dispute resolution improvements, indicating this may be less salient for improvement
4. **Task Design Focus**: 6% suggested task design improvements, primarily around time constraints
5. **Content Exposure**: Only 4% suggested improvements related to content exposure, suggesting this may be less of a priority for workers

## Representative Quotes by Domain

### Compensation & Economic Security (31 participants, 62.0%)

**Quote 1**: [P01, Q13] "Fair, transparent, and stable payment that reflects the actual time and effort involved is essential. Clear, consistent guidelines and honest feedback on task performance would help workers improve and feel valued."

**Quote 2**: [P35, Q13] "Pay should be better aligned with the complexity and emotional toll of the work. Tasks requiring more time or cognitive effort should be paid more. Instead of paying per task, offering hourly wages with a minimum rate could help make compensation more stable."

**Quote 3**: [P10, Q13] "i need fair payment, the other time i got 70 images to annotate for a fee of $1"

**Quote 4**: [P16, Q13] "Obviously the renumeration because the amount paid often make people rush though the task thus producing substandard work."

### Transparency & QA (9 participants, 18.0%)

**Quote 1**: [P36, Q13] "Clear guidelines, fair and timely pay, better support for dealing with tough content, and a simple appeal process would make data labeling work fairer and more respectful. Improved communication and transparency would also help."

**Quote 2**: [P43, Q13] "Data labeling work would be more fair and sustainable if platforms provided clearer guidelines, consistent feedback, and guaranteed minimum pay for time spentâ€”even on rejected tasks. Improved communication, mental health support, and greater transparency around how annotations are used would also help workers feel more respected and valued."

**Quote 3**: [P38, Q13] "Platforms should be more transparent about how work is reviewed and pay is determined. Clear, timely feedback when tasks are rejected would help us improve and feel valued."

### Support & Dispute Resolution (5 participants, 10.0%)

**Quote 1**: [P28, Q13] "Treat us like workers, give us feedback that is helpful, if we do good work give us promotions and offer some kind of community. Don't treat us like a number."

**Quote 2**: [P27, Q13] "I BELIEVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AND PARTICIPANTS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL"

**Quote 3**: [P31, Q13] "The researchers should improve on communication"

### Task Design & Time Pressure (3 participants, 6.0%)

**Quote 1**: [P20, Q13] "notify every time tasks are available"

**Quote 2**: [P08, Q13] "Work to be made available at times when I am free and to be completed at my leisure with a set deadline, rather than needed to be completed as soon as it is made available otherwise it will not be there later."

**Quote 3**: [P21, Q13] "adding multiple submission and add more places to the study"

### Content Exposure & Emotional Load (2 participants, 4.0%)

**Quote 1**: [P26, Q13] "There should be no disturbing content"

**Quote 2**: [P45, Q13] "Better data governance and bias mitigation. Independent bias audits and reporting on how labeling choices affect downstream models. Tools to adjust or customize labeling for diversity considerations (e.g., language/region variants). Clear expectations about how labels are used and how disagreements are resolved."

## Proposed Changes by Domain

### Compensation & Economic Security
**Proposed Changes** (based on 31 participants):

- **Provide helpful feedback**: Give constructive feedback that helps workers improve their performance
- **Create promotion opportunities**: Offer advancement opportunities for high-performing workers
- **Build worker community**: Foster community through forums, chat groups, or other social connections
- **Enhance researcher-worker interaction**: Improve communication between researchers and participants
- **Implement better support systems**: Create more responsive and helpful support channels (e.g., online bots)

### Task Design & Time Pressure
**Proposed Changes** (based on 3 participants):
- **Implement task notifications**: Notify workers when tasks become available
- **Create flexible scheduling**: Make work available at times when workers are free
- **Allow leisure completion**: Permit tasks to be completed at worker's pace with set deadlines
- **Expand task availability**: Add multiple submission options and more study places

### Content Exposure & Emotional Load
**Proposed Changes** (based on 2 participants):
- **Eliminate disturbing content**: Remove or filter out graphic, violent, or offensive material
- **Improve data governance**: Implement better bias mitigation and ethical data practices
- **Conduct independent audits**: Perform bias audits and report on labeling choice impacts
- **Offer diversity tools**: Provide tools to adjust labeling for diversity considerations

*Note: Mental health support, content warnings, and opt-out options were mentioned by participants in other domains (Compensation & Economic Security) but not specifically by participants coded to Content Exposure & Emotional Load.*

## Synthesis

The improvement suggestions reveal a clear hierarchy of worker priorities, with **compensation concerns dominating** (62% of participants) and revealing a fundamental disconnect between task complexity and pay rates. Workers consistently emphasize the need for **effort-pay alignment**, with many citing specific examples of inadequate compensation (e.g., "$1 for 70 images"). **Transparency issues** (18%) emerge as the second major theme, with workers seeking clearer guidelines, feedback processes, and understanding of how their work is used. While **support and communication** concerns are less prevalent (10%), they reveal deeper issues of worker recognition and community. The relatively low mention of **task design** (6%) and **content exposure** (4%) suggests these may be less salient improvement areas, though the few mentions highlight important structural constraints around scheduling and disturbing content. Overall, workers envision a more **transparent, fairly compensated, and supportive** data labeling ecosystem that recognizes their contributions and provides adequate resources for both professional development and mental health.
