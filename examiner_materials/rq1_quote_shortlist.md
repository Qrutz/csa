## Transparency & QA (44/50 participants, 88.0%)

**Codes**: disturbing_content; hate_speech; mental_impact; content_warnings; support_available

### Quote 2: Emotional Impact (P28)

Its like a competition with other fellow workers. Which can play havoc to sleep. Also, the paranoid of been banned or shadow banned when your dashboard has no work. And they is no recourse on why, or is it because there is no work and it is rather annoying especially if you need the work to help with finances."
