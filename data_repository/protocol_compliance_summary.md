- **Protocol refinement**: Routing rules clarified based on edge cases

#### ✅ Systematic Review
- **Batch processing**: Data reviewed in batches (1-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400)
- **Contradiction identification**: Positive statements coded as negative issues corrected
- **Domain reassignment**: Misclassified responses corrected
- **Code refinement**: Inappropriate codes removed, missing codes added

#### ✅ Final Validation
- **Prevalence statistics**: Calculated and verified
- **Quote selection**: Representative quotes identified and tagged
- **Cross-domain consistency**: Similar issues coded consistently across domains
