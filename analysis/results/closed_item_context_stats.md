# Closed-Item Context Stats

## Overview
These statistics provide context for the open-text analysis but are not used as direct evidence. They show response patterns to closed-item questions that complement the qualitative findings.

| Response | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Yes | 30 | 60.0% |
| No | 20 | 40.0% |

**Key Finding**: 60% have experienced task rejections, supporting the qualitative findings of widespread transparency and support issues.

## Q10: Disturbing Content Exposure
**Question**: "How often do you encounter content that you would describe as disturbing or harmful?"

| Response | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|

## Q11: Transparency Experience
**Question**: "Please describe your experience. You can write about how clear the platform is about task acceptance, rating systems, design choices, or payment rules."

| Response Type | Count | Percentage |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| Open-text responses | 44 | 88.0% |
| No response | 6 | 12.0% |

**Key Finding**: High response rate (88%) indicates strong engagement with transparency questions, supporting the qualitative findings of widespread transparency concerns.

## Context for Qualitative Analysis

These closed-item responses provide important context for interpreting the qualitative findings:

1. **Compensation Paradox**: While 64% report feeling "fairly compensated," the qualitative analysis reveals nuanced concerns about effort-pay mismatch, low rates, and payment volatility.

2. **Basic Needs Gap**: 72% report insufficient earnings, directly supporting the qualitative findings of compensation issues.

3. **Rejection Experience**: 60% have experienced rejections, explaining the high prevalence of transparency and support issues in qualitative responses.

4. **Content Exposure**: 36% report regular exposure to disturbing content, supporting the qualitative findings of significant content exposure concerns.

5. **Transparency Engagement**: High response rate to transparency questions suggests this is a salient concern for participants.

## Usage Note
These statistics are used for context only and do not constitute direct evidence for the research findings. The qualitative analysis of open-text responses provides the primary evidence base.
