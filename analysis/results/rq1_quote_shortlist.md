## Compensation & Economic Security

### Quote 1: Effort-Pay Mismatch (P01)

## Transparency & QA

### Quote 1: Data Usage Transparency (P01)
> "Most platforms provide minimal information about how tasks are reviewed or why certain submissions are rejected. Payment rules are vague, and sometimes task instructions are unclear or change without notice. There's little explanation about how our data is used or how quality is judged. The lack of clear feedback or appeal processes makes it feel like a black box—you're doing the work, but you don't know how it's being evaluated or where it ends up."

## Content Exposure & Emotional Load

### Quote 1: Disturbing Content (P01)
> "I've seen graphic images involving violence and offensive text content, including hate speech and harassment. It can be mentally draining and sometimes lingers after the task is done. Most platforms don't provide clear warnings or emotional support—you're often exposed without preparation, and there's no real way to opt out without risking income."

**Codes**: disturbing_content; hate_speech; mental_impact; content_warnings; support_available

### Quote 2: Emotional Impact (P28)
> "I was moderating comments and they were very disturbing and colourful and sometimes I felt illegal. Mentally/Emotionally initially can be quite distressing but overtime I become numb to the affects and accepted that was my job. There were warnings from the vendors but merely glance at it, I don't think they offer any kind of support, I think they just said you can simply optout on these tasks."

**Codes**: disturbing_content; work_stress; mental_impact; content_warnings; support_available

### Quote 3: Mental Strain (P30)
> "I once did a study that was emotionally disturbing and there was no warning given beforehand. I withdrew from the study"

## Task Design & Time Pressure

### Quote 1: Time Constraints (P28)
> "I think the biggest strain is when projects or tasks are released, there is no set time. You feel that you have to be online long enough in order to get your piece of the pie. Its like a competition with other fellow workers. Which can play havoc to sleep. Also, the paranoid of been banned or shadow banned when your dashboard has no work. And they is no recourse on why, or is it because there is no work and it is rather annoying especially if you need the work to help with finances."

**Codes**: time_constraints

### Quote 2: Task Design Challenges (P22)

### Quote 2: Platform Access Problems (P29)
