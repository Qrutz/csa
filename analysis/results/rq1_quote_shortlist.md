Payment rules are vague, and sometimes task instructions are unclear or change without notice. There's little explanation about how our data is used or how quality is judged.

### Quote 2: Emotional Impact (P28)

Its like a competition with other fellow workers. Which can play havoc to sleep. Also, the paranoid of been banned or shadow banned when your dashboard has no work.
