## RQ1: What challenges do data labeling workers face?

### Compensation & Economic Security (49/50 participants, 98.0%)

**Summary**: Compensation emerged as the most pervasive challenge, affecting nearly all participants (98%). Workers consistently reported that pay rates fail to reflect the actual time and effort required for tasks, with many describing compensation as "below minimum wage" when factoring in careful completion time. The most common issue was effort-pay mismatch, where workers felt their compensation was disproportionate to the complexity and duration of tasks. Payment inconsistency was also frequently mentioned, with some tasks paying fairly while others significantly underpaid or required unpaid additional work like qualifications or reviews. Despite these challenges, some workers (12%) reported positive compensation experiences, particularly on platforms like Prolific that offer transparent, stable payment structures.

**Key Evidence**: 36% of participants specifically mentioned effort-pay mismatch, with examples like "$1 for 70 images" illustrating the disconnect between task complexity and compensation. Workers emphasized that inadequate pay often forces them to rush through tasks, potentially compromising quality.

### Transparency & QA (44/50 participants, 88.0%)

**Summary**: Transparency and quality assurance issues affected 88% of participants, representing the second most prevalent challenge domain. Workers described a "black box" experience where they lack visibility into how their work is evaluated, why tasks are rejected, or how their data is ultimately used. The most common complaint centered on opaque rejection processes, with workers receiving rejections without clear explanations or justification from researchers. Rating systems were frequently described as non-transparent, leaving workers unable to understand how their performance is assessed or how to improve. While some participants (particularly those using Prolific) reported positive transparency experiences, the majority expressed frustration with unclear processes, vague payment rules, and lack of meaningful feedback mechanisms.

**Key Evidence**: Workers consistently emphasized the need for clearer guidelines, transparent rejection reasons, and better communication about how their work is reviewed and used. The lack of appeal processes and meaningful feedback was a recurring theme across responses.

### Content Exposure & Emotional Load (36/50 participants, 72.0%)

**Summary**: Content exposure and emotional load affected 72% of participants, representing a significant but less discussed challenge. Workers frequently encountered disturbing content including graphic images, violence, hate speech, and harassment without adequate preparation or support. The emotional impact was substantial, with workers describing content as "mentally draining" and noting that disturbing material "lingers after the task is done." Most platforms were criticized for providing minimal warnings about potentially harmful content and offering no meaningful emotional support or mental health resources. Workers often felt they had no real option to opt out of disturbing content without risking their income, creating a sense of being trapped in emotionally taxing work.

**Key Evidence**: Workers described specific examples of encountering graphic violence and offensive content, with many nofting that platforms provide only cursory warnings or no support for dealing with the psychological impact of such exposure.

### Support & Dispute Resolution (18/50 participants, 36.0%)

**Summary**: Support and dispute resolution challenges affected 36% of participants, revealing significant gaps in worker protection and recourse mechanisms. The most common issue was the lack of effective appeal processes, with workers describing attempts to dispute rejections or unfair treatment that resulted in no feedback or resolution. Communication problems between workers and researchers were frequently mentioned, with workers feeling unable to get meaningful responses to their concerns. The support systems were often described as inadequate, leaving workers without recourse when facing unfair treatment or technical issues. Workers expressed frustration with being treated "like a number" rather than as valued contributors to the research process.

**Key Evidence**: Workers described specific instances of trying to appeal rejections or communicate with researchers, only to receive no response or meaningful resolution, highlighting systemic gaps in worker support.

### Task Design & Time Pressure (15/50 participants, 30.0%)

**Summary**: Task design and time pressure issues affected 30% of participants, primarily centered around scheduling constraints and competitive work environments. Workers described feeling pressure to be constantly available to "get their piece of the pie" in a competitive environment with other workers. The lack of predictable task availability created anxiety and sleep disruption, with workers feeling they had to be online constantly to secure work. Time constraints were particularly problematic, with workers describing tasks that required immediate completion or risked being unavailable later. Technical issues like connectivity problems could result in uncompensated work due to strict time allocations, further exacerbating the pressure.

**Key Evidence**: Workers emphasized the competitive nature of task acquisition and the stress of unpredictable scheduling, with some describing sleep disruption and constant anxiety about missing work opportunities.

### Platform Reliability & Access (5/50 participants, 10.0%)

**Summary**: Platform reliability and access issues affected 10% of participants, representing the least common but still significant challenge domain. Workers described technical problems including system errors, connectivity issues, and developer mistakes that could result in lost work or uncompensated time. The most problematic aspect was the lack of recourse when technical issues occurred, with workers often unable to get compensation for time spent on tasks that failed due to platform problems. Communication about technical issues was often poor, leaving workers without explanation or resolution when problems occurred.

**Key Evidence**: Workers described specific instances of technical failures during task completion, with some noting that researchers would reject work without acknowledging technical issues or providing compensation for time spent.

## RQ2: What improvements do workers suggest?

### Compensation & Economic Security (31/50 participants, 62.0%)

**Summary**: Compensation improvements dominated worker suggestions, with 62% of participants proposing changes to make data labeling work more economically viable. The most common suggestion (36% of participants) focused on addressing effort-pay mismatch through better alignment between task complexity and compensation. Workers proposed implementing hourly wage structures with minimum rates, tiered payment systems based on complexity, and bonuses for accurate work. Specific examples of inadequate compensation (e.g., "$1 for 70 images") were frequently cited as evidence of the need for reform. Workers emphasized that fair compensation would reduce the pressure to rush through tasks and improve overall work quality. Some participants suggested that platforms should guarantee minimum pay even for rejected tasks, recognizing the time workers invest in completion.

**Key Evidence**: Workers consistently emphasized the need for "fair, transparent, and stable payment that reflects actual time and effort," with many proposing specific structural changes like hourly wages and complexity-based pay scales.

### Transparency & QA (9/50 participants, 18.0%)

**Summary**: Transparency improvements were suggested by 18% of participants, focusing on making work processes more visible and understandable. Workers emphasized the need for clearer guidelines, consistent feedback, and transparent rejection reasons. The most common suggestions centered on improving communication about how work is reviewed and evaluated, with workers seeking better understanding of quality standards and performance expectations. Workers also suggested greater transparency about how their annotations are used and how their work contributes to larger research goals. The lack of meaningful feedback and appeal processes was frequently mentioned as an area needing improvement, with workers seeking more responsive and helpful communication channels.

**Key Evidence**: Workers proposed "clearer guidelines, consistent feedback, and guaranteed minimum pay for time spentâ€”even on rejected tasks," emphasizing the need for transparent processes and better communication.

### Support & Dispute Resolution (5/50 participants, 10.0%)

**Summary**: Support and dispute resolution improvements were suggested by 10% of participants, focusing on better worker recognition and communication. Workers emphasized the need to be treated "like workers" rather than numbers, with suggestions for helpful feedback, promotion opportunities, and community building. The most common suggestions centered on improving communication between workers and researchers, with workers seeking more meaningful interactions and better support channels. Workers also suggested implementing better appeal processes and dispute resolution mechanisms to address unfair treatment or rejections. The need for community and professional development opportunities was frequently mentioned as a way to improve worker experience and retention.

**Key Evidence**: Workers proposed treating them "like workers, give us feedback that is helpful, if we do good work give us promotions and offer some kind of community," emphasizing recognition and professional development.

### Task Design & Time Pressure (3/50 participants, 6.0%)

**Summary**: Task design improvements were suggested by 6% of participants, focusing on scheduling flexibility and work availability. Workers emphasized the need for better notification systems to alert them when tasks become available, reducing the competitive pressure and anxiety around missing work opportunities. The most common suggestions centered on making work available at times when workers are free, with more flexible deadlines that allow completion "at leisure" rather than requiring immediate attention. Workers also suggested improvements to task submission processes, including multiple submission options and expanded study availability to reduce competition and improve access.

**Key Evidence**: Workers proposed "notify every time tasks are available" and making work available "at times when I am free and to be completed at my leisure with a set deadline," emphasizing scheduling flexibility.

### Content Exposure & Emotional Load (2/50 participants, 4.0%)

**Summary**: Content exposure improvements were suggested by only 4% of participants, representing the least prioritized improvement area. The most common suggestion was simply to eliminate disturbing content entirely, with one worker stating "There should be no disturbing content." However, one participant provided a more comprehensive suggestion focusing on better data governance and bias mitigation, including independent bias audits, reporting on how labeling choices affect downstream models, and tools for diversity considerations. This suggests that while content exposure may be less salient as an improvement priority, some workers recognize the broader ethical implications of their work and seek more responsible data practices.

**Key Evidence**: Workers proposed both simple solutions ("no disturbing content") and more complex approaches involving "better data governance and bias mitigation" with independent audits and diversity considerations.

## Cross-Domain Synthesis

The findings reveal a clear hierarchy of worker priorities, with **compensation concerns dominating** both challenges (98% in RQ1) and improvement suggestions (62% in RQ2). This suggests that economic security is the fundamental issue underlying other problems in data labeling work. **Transparency issues** represent the second major theme, affecting 88% of workers in RQ1 and generating 18% of improvement suggestions in RQ2, indicating that while transparency problems are widespread, workers may see compensation as a more immediate priority for improvement.

The relatively low mention of **support and communication** improvements (10% in RQ2) compared to their prevalence as challenges (36% in RQ1) suggests that workers may view these as secondary to economic and transparency issues. Similarly, **task design** and **content exposure** improvements received minimal attention (6% and 4% respectively), indicating that while these represent real challenges, they may be less salient for workers when considering potential improvements.

Overall, workers envision a more **transparent, fairly compensated, and supportive** data labeling ecosystem that recognizes their contributions and provides adequate resources for both professional development and mental health. The emphasis on effort-pay alignment, transparent processes, and worker recognition suggests a desire for professionalization of data labeling work rather than its current gig economy model.
