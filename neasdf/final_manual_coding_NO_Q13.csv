What happened: a content removal, a warning, a temporary suspension, a permanent ban, a feature limit, etc.

Reason given: the exact policy or wording in the notice (e.g., “violates policy on hate speech” or “spam/duplicate content”).
How the platform handled it: content was removed, account restricted, features limited, warnings issued, time limits, policy updates, etc.

Re-submission rules: whether you can revise and re-submit, and under what conditions.
